# Overview

This is an exploratory solver for the NYT's word game "[Letter Boxed](https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/letter-boxed)".

I wanted to see if I could find optimal results (fewest letters to achieve total coverage) and had a hunch a [trie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie) would make a good solution, so I stole an implementation from [this Leetcode problem solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-trie-prefix-tree/discuss/58834/AC-Python-Solution) and started exploring.

I'm sure there are inefficiencies, but this was good practice!
